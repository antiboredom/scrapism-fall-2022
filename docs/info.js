They have worked in XR for several companies, most recently TikTok. Currently, they are taking time off to cultivate their art practice before deciding what to do next. Their work uses simulation, computer graphics, and mixed media to speculate about language, ecology, and identity. They live with a bunch of plants and isopods, and one big mystery snail.",

While uncovering their schemes, she seeks to highlight their dysfunction, both visually and critically, by probing the soil and structural layers of obfuscation. She creates experiments ranging from the size of the sheet of paper to the volume of a space; somewhere between writing, archiving, drawing, performing, designing, and programming. <br/><br/>
        Bouquet is a resident of LaMezz in Pierre Bénite, a recipient of the Jean-Luc Lagardère Fondation Grant, a former resident at the School For Poetic Computation, Les Storygraphes, and Le Bel Ordinaire. She has exhibited at Maintenant festival in Rennes, Draaimolen festival in Tilburg, at Eastern Bloc in Montreal, during the Biennale Internationale Design de Saint-Etienne and at the Cité du Design in Saint-Etienne, during the Radical Network festival and at the SFPC fall 2019 showcase in New York City; and more recently at the Maif Social Club in Paris during the Biennale Némo - International digital arts biennial and at L'Attrape-Couleur in Lyon during the exhibition of the artist Pierre Boggio.<br/><br>
